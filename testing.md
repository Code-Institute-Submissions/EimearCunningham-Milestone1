# Testing
## Validation Services
The [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) and the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate all HTML5 and CSS3 code.

### Errors / Warnings found by W3C Markup Validation Service:
- "Error: No p element in scope but a p end tag seen." This error appeared 3 times - 
Once per every paragraph in the Work Experience Timeline (Code taken from Bootsnipp).
I realised that this error was occuring because a H4 element was being placed **inside** a paragraph element. I fixed this by simply moving the H4 element outside the Paragraph element.

### Errors / Warnings found by W3C CSS Validation Service:
- No Errors found.
- Warnings: Ignored as these extensions are needed for different browsers.
    - -moz-transition is an unknown vendor extension
	- -webkit-transition is an unknown vendor extension
