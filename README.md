Live website: https://eimearcunningham.github.io/Milestone1/

An online resume for interested recruiters to learn more about me.

The main aim of this website is to create an online presence for myself for the purpose of being hired.
 
# UX
 
### Who this website is for:
* This website is for recruiters interested in hiring me.

### What they want to achieve:
* They want to learn more about me, get a feel for my work and potentially contact me.

### This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:
* The website is easy to navigate and uses a clear layout to display my skills, projects and work experience.

* The Contact Me section is easy to find and provides a form to contact me directly as well as my contact details.

## User Stories:
1. As a recruiter, I want to learn more about this candidate, 
including their skills.
2. As a recruiter, I want to view projects that this candidate 
has worked on to get a feel for their work.
3. As a recruiter, I want to view the candidates relevant work 
experience.
4. As a recruiter, I want to be able to easily see how I can contact 
the candidate should I wish to get in touch.
5. As a recruiter, I want to be able to download the candidateâ€™s 
CV in PDF format.

## Design 
- Color Scheme - I decided on using a blue-green and grey-white color scheme for my Resume Page. This was mainly because blue-green shades are associated with feelings of trust and stability, while grey and white evoke feelings of maturity with a clean finish.
    - #54B6B6 - A "fountain blue" shade was chosen for the header and footer background. This was also used for the text color of each heading on the page.
    - #E5F0F0 - A "zircon" shade of light blue was chosen for the background of 2 out of 4 sections. This tied in nicely with the "fountain blue" shade.
    - #F5F5F5 - A shade of "whitesmoke" was selected for the remaing two section backgrounds.
    - #FAFAFA - A "snow" shade selected for text inside the Header and Footer. This provides a nice contrast between the text and background shades.
    - #E0E0E0 - A "gainsboro" shade selected for the hover state for Navbar links and Footer links. This shade of grey provides a subtle color change when hovering over clickable links. 


- Typography 
    - Google Font "Montserrat" was used for all text on the page. This is a commonly used font that creates feelings of trust. I chose this font for this reason as well as the clean, simple finish which goes with the overall theme of my page.

# Features

### Header
* Header Logo - A fixed-top, clickable logo which brings users back to the top of the page, as would be expected.
* Navigation Bar - Also fixed-top, the navigation bar contains links to each section of the page. This means that as the user scrolls through the page they always have to option to get to another section.

### About Me Section 
* Link to Download CV - An easy to see link for the user to download my CV as a PDF.
* Main Image - A professional headshot of myself.
* List of Skills - A list of my skills using Font Awesome Icons and Hover.css to make interactive for the user.

### Projects Section
* Album with Links to Projects - A Bootstrap album with three thumbnails to display my portfolio.

### Work Experience Section
* Timeline with relevant Work Experience - A timeline created using modified code from Bootsnipp.com to display my recent work experience.

### Contact Me Section

### Footer
* Contact Information - Displayed directly under the Contact Form, should users wish to contact me directly via phone / email.
* Social Media Links - Links to my Facebook, GitHub and Twitter profiles.
* Link to Download CV - A second link to download my CV in PDF format. This will save the user from going back to the top of the page should they wish to download my CV.

### Features Left to Implement
